Create an AI-powered CV filtering website using Next.js with integrated OpenAI API and email inbox connection (Gmail/Outlook).

The system must allow HR or recruiters to:

Log in using their company email (Gmail or Outlook)

Automatically fetch CV attachments from their inbox

Enter a job prompt / role description

Use OpenAI API to analyze the CVs

Score each resume from 0–100 based on the prompt

Rank resumes from best to worst

Display matches exactly given images

there should be a dark mode also

No documentation.
No design work.
Just a working functional product.

🛠 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

You must use:

Next.js (latest)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS (basic styling only)

NextAuth for login

Google OAuth

Microsoft Outlook OAuth

OpenAI API (client provides key)

Gmail API

Microsoft Graph API

Node-based file parsing tools

pdf-parse

docx

Prisma ORM

PostgreSQL

No other tech stack unless required for email or CV extraction.

📌 CORE FEATURES (STRICT SCOPE)
1. Login System

Implement login using:

Google OAuth

Microsoft Outlook OAuth

After login → redirect to dashboard.

2. Fetch CVs from Email Inbox

Using Gmail API OR Microsoft Graph API:

Connect using logged-in user’s access token

Fetch inbox emails

Detect emails with CV attachments (PDF, DOC, DOCX)

Download attachments

Extract text from each file

Save extracted CV content into PostgreSQL

Save original file link or buffer

Only inbox fetching — no sending email, no advanced filtering.

3. AI-Based CV Scoring

User enters a job prompt.

Using OpenAI API:

Compare job prompt with each CV

Score resume 0–100

Generate short reasoning:

Strengths (1–3 bullet points)

Weaknesses (1–3 bullet points)

Store results in the database

4. Resume Ranking

Automatically:

Sort resumes from highest score to lowest

Display them in a simple layout:

Candidate name (from email or file)

Score

Strengths

Weaknesses

Button to view extracted text

Button to download original CV

Sorting must be automatic.
